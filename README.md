# LandingNet
Azure Web App (IIS) rules to filter out noise traffic from scriptkiddies and their tools. If you'd like to hang up on these requests instead of rewriting to stub, use:

```xml
<action type="AbortRequest" />
```

# License
Since this is a set of configuration settings and not software (code), I'm not even sure if I should say this specifically - but this is distributed under the most permissive license known to me - MIT license. Feel free to do whatever you want with these rules.
